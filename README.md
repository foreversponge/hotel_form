# hotel_form

This is my first experience with PHP. It consists of a website that simulates a hotel booking form with a required authenticated login and register page. The PHP backend handle the business logic such as validating the input and search the available rooms with a matching hotel depending on the user's inputs. In addition, it handles the authentication.
